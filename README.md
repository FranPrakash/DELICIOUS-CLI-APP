## An interesting piece of code

#### I find it very interesting how I can use an interface as a type for an ArrayList. The ArrayList can then accepts any object from the classes that implement the interface. For example, it can store a sandwich object, a chip object or a drink objcet. It reduces the lines of code because I dont need to create many separate lists.
